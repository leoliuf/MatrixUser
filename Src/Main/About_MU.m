% MatrixUser, a multi-dimensional matrix analysis software package
% https://sourceforge.net/projects/matrixuser/
% 
% The MatrixUser is a matrix analysis software package developed under Matlab
% Graphical User Interface Developing Environment (GUIDE). It features 
% functions that are designed and optimized for working with multi-dimensional
% matrix under Matlab. These functions typically includes functions for 
% multi-dimensional matrix display, matrix (image stack) analysis and matrix 
% processing.

function varargout = About_MU(varargin)
% ABOUT_MU M-file for About_MU.fig
%      ABOUT_MU, by itself, creates a new ABOUT_MU or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = ABOUT_MU returns the handle to a new ABOUT_MU or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      ABOUT_MU('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in ABOUT_MU.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      ABOUT_MU('Property','Value',...) creates a new ABOUT_MU or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before About_MU_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to About_MU_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
